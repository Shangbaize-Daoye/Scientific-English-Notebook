    The media may exaggerate a hero’s negative side in order to gain more nationwide publicity.

$ derogatory remarks and biased public opinions
    In such extreme cases, media scrutiny could lead to derogatory remarks and biased public opinion about heroes.

$ probe into one's personal life
    The argument above presumes that the media will excessively probe into heroes’ personal lives in painstaking detail and focus on the negative side.

    Even if politically motivated, it would be impossible to require the whole media to give undivided attention to a hero’s dark side.

$
    A hero or heroine is a person who, in the face of danger, combats adversity through feats of ingenuity, bravery or strength.

$
    If he indeed has ever saved others’ lives at risk of sacrificing his own life, it is not stunning at all that he will still be considered as a hero, as a consequence of the very fact that it is the valor and commitment demonstrated by his paying ultimate price that outweigh the stain on his character and earn him the title of hero.

    In some cases, remaining loyal to high moral principles without any chance of compromise will weaken the effectiveness of a leader.

$ weaken/promote a leader's effectiveness

$
    The primary goal of a leader of one country plagued by terrorism is to defend people and improve national security.

$
    If the leader could lead the nation to win the war on terror, he or she must be considered effective in spite of some immoral means taken to achieve the goal.

$
    Indeed, while leaders with superior moral qualities are more likely to be effective, effectiveness does not necessarily originate in the moral standards.

$ equate to
    It is evident that high moral qualities do not equate to effective leadership.

    Students should persue subjects that interests them.
    Should college students be encouraged to take classes that truly interest them or select courses that seem most likely to enhance their competitiveness in the job market?

$ should take precedence over practical concerns
    In the ideal case, pursuing interests should take precedence over practical concerns.

$
    It is also worth pointing out that students can take online courses while also taking classes specifically to improve their employment prospects.

$
    While the prospect of a well-paid/decent job may seem like a strong motive, it is far less effective than personal interest.

$
    This is because if students strive for decent careers, it takes a long time for their efforts to pay off.

$ sustain their motivation for learning

$
    This assumption may not always hold true because the job market changes so quickly that we can hardly make precise prediction.

$
    New programming languages and frameworks spring up incessantly as time goes on.

$
    A few years ago students who sought a job in web development only had to learn JavaScript or JSP, and yet they must now learn TypeScript, Angular, Vue and so forth in order to keep abreast of everything that pops up in this area.

$
    In short/In other words, such “useful” courses can become obsolete by the time students graduate because of the short timescale of changes in the job market. Clearly it is an undesirable outcome for students.

$
    In such case, the argument that a future career is not the strong motivation does not hold true because the desire to change one’s fate can be extremely powerful.

    However, acquiring sufficient language proficiency so as to have little difficulty communicating both academically and in daily lives, is incredibly time-consuming.

$
    Exchange students should possess an intense passion for various cultures and an appreciation for multiculturalism.

$
    In addition, while communication with different cultures is appealing and indispensable for university students, not only does such communication result from an overseas experience, but it can be also achieved through introduction of foreign teachers into students’ home country.

$
    This policy demonstrates advantages...

    Besides, when it comes to a case where exchange students are selected, we should guarantee that only those who sufficiently embody their countries are provided with opportunities.

    At first glance, the arguer's argument appears to be somewhat convincing, but further reflection reveals that it omits some substantial concerns that should be addressed to substantiate the argument.

$ automobile mechanical failures
    This assumption, however, is problematic because we are not informed with the exact number of the accidents. Nor do we know whether these teenager drivers are to blame for these accidents. Maybe these driving accidents are caused by automobile mechanical failures.

$ The accidents could be attributed to factors other than local teenager drivers' negligence.

$ use their unavailability as an excuse to conceal the fact that they are reluctant to teach

$ make up only a small part of
    Those truly busy parents, therefore, could make up only a mall part of all parents.

$ lend strong support to what the arguer maintains
    The arguer fails to substantiate its claim, because the evidences cited in the analysis do not lend strong support to what the arguer maintains.

$ does not sufficiently indicate a healthier state of people in Shanghai

$
    The lower proportion could also be explained by unsatisfactory medical resources in Leeville, both in terms of the number of hospitals and the capabilities of local doctors.

$ 不太可能是。。。的原因
    is less responsible for
    If this is the case, then the relaxed pace of life in Leeville is less responsible for local people's excellent health, because Leeville citizens could be suffering from a variety of diseases, which have been neither diagnosed nor treated.

$
    Generally speaking, good health state stems from a variety of factors: appealing environment, pleasant social relationships, and healthy diets, to name a few.

$
    We are confident that these explanations could rival the one proposed in the argument.

$
    There are several alternative explanations that could challenge the author's and can also plausibly account for the facts presented in the argument.

$
    It is unreasonable to draw a hasty conclusion about which explanation is the best until further examination concerning Leeville town is performed.
